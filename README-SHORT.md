# edgemicro-decorator short version
This is the short version of the edgemicro-decorator documentation.

** Please note that the edgemicro-decorator will execute only if you bind the Cloud Foundry app to the `edgemicro_service`.**

1. You must have access to Edge and you must complete the following.
  * Create an edgemicro aware proxy.
  * Create an Apigee product.
  * Create an Apigee App.

  These steps are detailed [here](http://docs.apigee.com/microgateway/latest/setting-and-configuring-edge-microgateway#Part2).

  The only difference is that when you create your proxy in the Edge UI make sure to set the `Proxy Base Path` to `/edgemicro_hello` and
  your `Existing API` (target server) will be http://localhost:8090.

2. Install and start [PCF Dev](https://pivotal.io/platform/pcf-tutorials/getting-started-with-pivotal-cloud-foundry-dev/introduction).

NOTE: you can stop after you execute the `cf dev start` command.

Next execute the following command to login to PCF Dev:
```
cf login -a api.local.pcfdev.io --skip-ssl-validation
```

And enter the following when prompted.
```
API endpoint:  api.local.pcfdev.io   
Email>     admin
Password>  admin
```

Select the following Cloud Foundry org and space.
```
pcfdev-org
pcfdev-space
```

3. Clone meta-buildpack decorator into your Github directory and upload it to PCF Dev.
```
git clone https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/meta-buildpack.git
cd meta-buildpack
./build
./upload
```

4. Clone the edgemicro-decorator into your Github directory and upload it to PCF Dev.
Please note that this repo will eventually be moved to /apigee/edgemicro-decorator location.

```
git clone https://github.com/swilliams11/edgemicro-decorator.git
cd edgemicro-decorator
./upload
```

5. Clone the Spring Boot hello world sample application and push it to PCF Dev.

```
git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-rest-service.git
cd gs-rest-service/complete
```

You must modify the `manifest.yaml` file with the changes shown below.
```
name: spring_hello
domain: local.pcfdev.io

env:
  JBP_CONFIG_JAVA_MAIN: '{arguments: "--server.port=8090"}'
```

Build the jar file:
```
./gradlew build
```

Then push the application to PCF Dev and enable diego.

Make sure to install the Diego plugin first.  
```
https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/Diego-Enabler
```

```
cf push --no-start -m 512M
cf enable-diego spring_hello
```

6. Create the Edge Microgateway User Defined Service Instance with the following command in Cloud Foundry.
However, you must update all the fields with CHANGEME.

If you are using an on-premise installation of Edge then use the service instance below.
```
cf cups edgemicro_service -p '{"application_name":"edgemicro_service", "org":"CHANGEME", "env":"CHANGEME", "user":"CHANGEME","pass":"CHANGEME", "nodejs_version_number": "6.10.2", "edgemicro_version":"2.3.1", "edgemicro_port":"8080", "onpremises": "true", "onprem_config" : {"runtime_url": "http://CHANGEME:9001", "mgmt_url" : "http://CHANGEME:8080", "virtual_host" : "default"}, "tags": ["edgemicro"]}'
```

If you are using an Apigee SaaS organization then use the following service instance.
```
cf cups edgemicro_service -p '{"application_name":"edgemicro_service", "org":"CHANGEME", "env":"CHANGEME", "user":"CHANGEME","pass":"CHANGEME", "nodejs_version_number": "6.10.2", "edgemicro_version":"2.3.1", "edgemicro_port":"8080", "tags": ["edgemicro"]}'
```

Bind the service to the Cloud Foundry App
```
cf bind-service spring_hello edgemicro_service
```

7. Restart the spring_hello service
```
cf restage spring_hello
```

8. Test the service.

Will fail without a valid token.
```
curl http://rest-service.local.pcfdev.io/edgemicro_hello
```

Get a valid token.
```
curl -X POST "http://CHANGEME/edgemicro-auth/token" -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"client_id":"CHANGEME","client_secret":"CHANGEME","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
```

OR

```
edgemicro token get -o [org] -e [env] -i [client_id] -s [client_secret]
```

Send request to CF with a valid token.
```
curl http://rest-service.local.pcfdev.io/edgemicro_hello -H "Authorization: Bearer CHANGEME_JWT"
```
